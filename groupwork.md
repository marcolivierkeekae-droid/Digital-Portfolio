<h1>Group Work Reflections</h1> 
<p>Details about my group projects and learnings.</p>

<article>
  <h2>Forming</h2>
  <p>The group was formed somewhat spontaneously,but i approched it with intention.I wanted a group that would bring out the best in me,ideally someone reliable,works well under pressure,and also somewhat the slacker of the group who would probably be given a difficult task regardless of how they present themselves.I saw it as an opportunity to obesrve and experiment with group dynamics,testing how different personalities function regarding the task at hand.I also knew my teammates beforehand,not much, but enough to know they are would be reliable.</p>

  <h2>Storming</h2>
  <p>There were challenges,where our first designated leader was briefly late to a scheduled meeting,it was unprecedented, but i knew they would not be able to play the role well.Since the discussion could not commence without their insight, we decided to appoint someone else to lead temporarily.This abrupt shift showed how adaptable how group could be under pressure. </p>

  <h2>Norming</h2>
  <p>We agreed on shared expectations being whatsapp and Teams calls on days we were not busy for our discussions,encouraging open feedback.</p>

  <h2>Perfoming</h2>
  <p>We performed reasonably well, regardless of challenges we experienced,in which we supported each other on,we were functioning like a real team,everyone played their role well. </p>

  <h2>Adjourning</h2>
  <p>A wierdly abrupt closure,there was nothing special like picture taking celebrating our perfomance, but we were just hopeful that we did well and relieved that it was over,I for one did not expect the way we supposedly had to present i expected an audience,but alas it was a  fun educational experience</p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <p>This experience was a fun yet challenging experience,it showed me how one person can not handle everything by themselves,the importance of teamwork and to be open-minded to nudges/advices offered,adaptability and balance</p>
